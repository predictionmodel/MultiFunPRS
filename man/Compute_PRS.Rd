\title{Compute Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Based on Potential Causal SNPs and Their Weights}
\usage{
Compute_PRS(snp_list, genotype, beta_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp_list}{Character vector of SNP IDs to be used in PRS calculation.}

\item{genotype}{A data frame containing genotype data with rows as individuals and columns as SNPs.
Must include an "ID" column for individual identifiers.}

\item{beta_values}{A data frame containing SNP effect sizes with at least two columns:
"rsID" (SNP ID) and "beta" (effect size).}
}
\value{
A list containing one element:
- \code{PRS}: A data frame with two columns: \code{ID} and \code{PRS}, representing individual IDs and their computed PRS scores.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) using a set of potential causal SNPs
and their corresponding effect sizes (beta values). Missing genotypes are imputed as 0.
For each SNP, if the beta coefficient is positive, the score is calculated by multiplying
the genotype dosage with beta; if negative, it uses the complementary allele dosage.

# Example usage:
prs_result <- compute_prs(snp_list = c("rs123", "rs456"), 
                          genotype = Geno,
                          beta_values = Beta)

}
